A young woman with long, flowing auburn hair and delicate freckles is positioned on a gray concrete rooftop overlooking a city skyline at dusk. She is wearing a flowing, emerald green silk dress and simple gold hoop earrings. A professional photographer, a man in his late 40s with a focused expression and a black t-shirt and jeans, adjusts a large studio light. Soft, diffused light illuminates the woman, casting long shadows across the rooftop. She is mid-pose, her body angled gracefully, one hand resting lightly on her hip, and a subtle, serene smile on her face. The photographer speaks in a calm, encouraging voice: \"Just a little more to the left, darling. Beautiful.\" A quiet hum from the studio lights is audible, along with the distant sounds of city traffic—a low rumble of cars and occasional sirens. The wind gently rustles the woman’s hair and the silk of her dress, creating a soft, whispering sound. The photographer clicks the camera—a sharp, definitive sound—and then speaks again: \"Perfect. Hold that.\"","negative_prompt":"low quality, blurry","seed":42,"width":768,"height":512,"num_frames":121,"cfg_scale":3,"enhance_prompt":true,"upscale":true,"pipeline_override":"auto","timeline":[],"last_job_id":"job_b8e47013"},{"id":"292e1b75-5c11-48cc-818c-26bfcfbec89a","prompt":"the woman changes her pose","negative_prompt":"low quality, blurry","seed":42,"width":768,"height":512,"num_frames":121,"cfg_scale":3,"enhance_prompt":true,"upscale":true,"pipeline_override":"auto","timeline":[{"type":"image","path":"/uploads/job_b8e47013_last.jpg","frame_index":0,"strength":1}],"last_job_id":"job_01522b8b"}]}
